# What is Prompt Engieneering

Prompt engineering doc is designed to optimize your ideation process and enhance your output quality. The document is comprised of two main types of prompts: Simple prompts and advanced prompts. The simplified prompts are ideal for generating quick ideas and obtaining concise answers with minimal effort. 

The advanced prompts delve into the intricacies of crafting detailed inputs that yield comprehensive outputs
suitable for personal and business purposes.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts used in natural language processing
(NLP) models, such as ChatGPT, chatbots, or virtual assistants. This involves crafting prompts that are clear,
concise, and effective in eliciting the desired response. (Aka prompt engineering is like making an effective fishing
lure - just as a well-designed lure is more likely to catch the fish you want, a well-crafted prompt is more likely to
elicit the desired response.)

# Principles for Prompt Engineering

1. Be specific: The more criteria you give, the more focused the output will be.
2. Work in steps: Break tasks into small chunks. This returns better results, just as it would with a human.
3. Iterate and improve: Re-work the inputs and have ChatGPT improve on its own output.

# Prompt Priming

“Priming” refers to the practice of providing some initial input to the model before generating a response. The
initial input is intended to guide the model toward generating a response that is more relevant and coherent with
the user's intended output. (You can input entire pieces of text you’ve written for ChatGPT to be trained on)*

### Example

**Without priming:** Where should I go on my next vacation?

**With priming:** I’d like to go on a trip with my wife, the location should be tropical, we’d love to be close to
the beach, I’d like the flight to be one direct flight to and from LAX, and I have a travel budget of $5,000. Where
should I go on my next vacation?

**Priming Output:** One suggestion for your tropical family vacation within a $5,000 budget could be Cancun,
Mexico. Direct flights from LAX are available, and you can find affordable all-inclusive packages with prices
starting at around $1,000 per person for a week-long stay. Popular family activities in Cancun include snorkeling,
visiting ancient ruins, and exploring local beaches and restaurants.
