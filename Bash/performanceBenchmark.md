# node package manager benchmark

Below is the bash script that can be exeucted from the root of the project to determine speed of installation.

It compares the speed for warm install and cold install.

---
## Warm Install

#### Definition:

A warm install is when the dependencies are already present, so the package manager mostly reuses cached packages and updates only whatâ€™s needed.

#### How it works in the script:

Leaves node_modules and lockfiles intact.

---
## Cold Install

#### Definition:

A cold install is when you install all project dependencies from scratch, without any existing node_modules folder or lockfiles.

#### How it works in the script:

```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml
```


Deletes any previously installed modules and lockfiles.

Forces the package manager to download and install everything anew from the registry.
