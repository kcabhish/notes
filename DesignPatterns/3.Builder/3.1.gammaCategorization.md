# Gamma Categoraization

* This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.
* Design patterns are typically split into three categories

## Creational Patterns

- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
- Wholesale (single staement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

## Structural Patterns

- Concerned with the strucuture (eg. class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
- Stress the importance of good API design

## Behavioral Patterns

- There is not central theme to this pattern, the them will be determined based on the use case.
