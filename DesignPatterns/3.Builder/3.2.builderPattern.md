# Builder Pattern

This pattern is used when constructiong ets a little bit too compicated. WHen piecewise object construciton is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinclty.

## Motivation

- Some objects are smple and can be created in a single initializer call.
- Other objeccts require a log of ceremony to create.
- Having an objet with 10 initializer arguments is not productive.
- Instead, opt for piecewise construction
- Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.
