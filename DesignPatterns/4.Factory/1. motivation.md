# Motivation

- Object creation logic becomes too convoluted.
- Initializer is not descriptive.
    - Name is always __init__
    - cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names.
    - can turn into `optional parameter hell`
- Wholesale object creation (non-piecewise, unlike builder) can be outsourced to a separate method (Factory Method).

A Factory is a component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

eg: Builder builds a car, factory builds legion of cars with brands. Like builder is toyota and factory builds camry, corola and rav4s.
