# What is Spring?

Spring is an open-source framework created in 2002 to simplify Java development. It provides a collection of libraries that address common challenges faced by Java developers, making our daily tasks easier. Here are a few of those libraries:

spring-core: Provides the fundamental parts of the framework, including the IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
spring-web: Contains logic for developing REST endpoints, handling web requests, and integrating with web technologies.
spring-security: Addresses security concerns, including authentication and authorization for your applications.
spring-data: Simplifies data access and manipulation across different data sources, such as relational databases and NoSQL databases.
spring-mvc: Provides features for building web applications, including model-view-controller architecture support.
spring-test: Allows you to write unit tests and integration tests for Spring applications.

# What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework, introduced in 2014, that simplifies the development of new Spring applications. Created to streamline the setup and development process, Spring Boot allows developers to get started quickly without the need for extensive configuration. Here’s how Spring Boot achieves this:

Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added, reducing the need for manual setup.
Standalone Applications: Allows you to create standalone applications that can run independently without the need for an external application server.
Embedded Servers: Includes embedded web servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, so you don’t have to deploy your application to an external server.
Production-Ready Features: Provides built-in support for features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration, which are essential for production environments.
Opinionated Defaults: Offers sensible defaults to reduce the amount of boilerplate code and configuration, enabling you to focus on building your application.
Spring Boot Starters: Provides a set of pre-configured starter dependencies that simplify the process of adding functionalities like web, security, and data access to your project.
By leveraging these features, Spring Boot significantly enhances productivity, allowing developers to build robust and scalable applications with minimal effort. Spring Boot streamlines Spring development to such an extent that developing Spring applications without it seems almost unimaginable. Therefore, in this course, we'll treat Spring and Spring Boot as if they were one and the same.
