# Insecure Design

Insecure design is focussed primariliy on architectural and design weakness. This category differentiates between design limitations and implemntation defects and ahave different weakness and remediations.

Generally, insecure design can hve multipole implementation flaws that can lead to exploitation of inforation assets, nd can never be overcome by a perfect implementation or rorchestration.

## What is a threat model

[Threat Modeling Failures](https://www.alldaydevops.com/blog/how-to-fail-at-threat-modeling)

There are number of testing methodologies and verification procedures that can help with identifying these issues.

### SAST Static Application Security Testing

- Examines the code to identify any software design and implementation flaws.
- Looks for weakness like SQL injection, hard coded credentials, unsafe coding practises, etc.

### DAST Dynamic Application Security Testing

- examines an application when its running to find vulnerabilities.
- runs automated tests or scans to check for common securioty vunlerabilities and weaknesses such as race-conditions, timiong dependent function that don;t work properly, unvalidated redirects, and other logic-based vulnerabilities.

### SCA Security Compostion Analysis

- Helps find the publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within common dependencies and ibraries.

## Summary

- Insecure Design focuses on design and implementation flaws, expressed as a "missing and ineffective control design"
- It cannotbe fixed by a perfect implementation, it call tfor threat modeling and secure design architecture.
- With the helpo of strong threat modeling and secure architecture, known and unknown threats and weaknesses can be identified and mitigated early.
- Testing and verification procdedures are also important in building secuirty.
- SAST, DAST, and SCA can help finding logic based vulnerabilities and those which are hard to capture using automated scanners.
