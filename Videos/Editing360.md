The following steps needs to be taken while creating the project.

1. To install the Kartaverse, drag the fusion reactor from the download in into the davinci app, it will install the required plugins.
2. After the installation is complete it will open up the Fusion Reactor tool, select Kartavers and search for `KartaVR Tools | reframe360 Ultra` and install it.
   If the tool does not open you can access it using Workspace -> Scripts -> Comp -> Reactor -> Open Reactor
3. Create a timeline with the following settings.
   - Disable `use project settings` checkbox.
   - On Format size select the resolution you want.
