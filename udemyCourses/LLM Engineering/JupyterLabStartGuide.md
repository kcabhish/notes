# Jupyter Lab

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment (IDE) designed for working with Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. It is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter, offering more flexibility and features compared to the classic Jupyter Notebook interface.

Fully supports Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for writing code, markdown, and visualizations.

# Typical Use Case

- Data exploration and visualization.
- Machine learning model development.
- Interactive data analysis.
- Educational and research purposes.

# Launch Jupyter Lab

After installingwith pip or conda, run:
```Python
jupyter lab
```
